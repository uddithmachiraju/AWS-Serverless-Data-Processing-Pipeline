# --------------------- AWS Serverless API Gateway ------------------------ # 

I was going to build a AWS Serverless API Gateway(REST) for an Book store or may be think of it like an library.
I will be building 4 api endpoints:

1. /books/
	Method - GET
	Purpose - Gets all the books in the database.
	
2. /books/add
	Method - POST 
	purpose - Adds a book to the database.

3. /books/update/<id> 
	Method - PUT
	Purpose - Updates a record in the database.

4. /books/delete/<id> 
	Method - DELETE 
	Purpose - Deletes a record from the database.

I was going to build everthing in terraform.
