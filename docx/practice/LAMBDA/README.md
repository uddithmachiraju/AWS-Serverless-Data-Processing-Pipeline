AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service from AWS that allows you to run code without actually managing the servers. It's an event driven service, meaning your code is triggered by events. Youu don't need to manage servers and underlying resources. It will automatically scale up or down the resources based on the requests and everything.

3. Function as a Service
4. Automatic scaling
5. Deployment

How it Works:

2. Create a lambda function and other configurations.
