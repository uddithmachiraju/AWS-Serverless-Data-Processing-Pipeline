In this project, I was going to build a **serverless Data Processing Pipeline** in AWS. I havn't yet thought of the full fledged process yet. But, the planned steps are;
1. Take input data via the public REST API 
2. Stores in the S3 bucket
3. Trigers a Lambda function when new data added (process the data)
4. Adds the data to the DynamoDB
